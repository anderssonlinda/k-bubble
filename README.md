A version of the 90's game Tamagotchi. In this version the player tries to look after a koala by meeting its needs. 
## Development
### Technologies used:
- React
- HTML
- CSS

### Planning
My goal was to get familiar with using React components and states so I decided to do a simple single page application to practice those aspects of React. The main part of my planning was drawing up a rough plan in powerpoint with ideas for layout and how the functionality would work.

### Problems
- App loads very slowly
Beacuse the app uses a lot of images and gifs it loads very slowly and timing with css animations is sometimes very off. I compressed all the images and gifs and had a huge improvment without loosing too much quality but it would be worth looking into how to make it more fluid and less choppy in the future.
